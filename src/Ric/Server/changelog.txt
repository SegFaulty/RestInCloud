0.8.0 2019-05-09 list method remove default limit 100 and hard limit 1000, if limit omitted list will return all existing files, chunking is not an advantage, because start <- has to iterate over all files step by step
0.8.1 2021-12-03 added logging (see dist config), add dynamic timeout for syncing to cluster servers 1s for 1MB (min 180s) (before: 60s fix)
